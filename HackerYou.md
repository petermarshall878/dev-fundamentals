## Two ways of creating your array and adding to your array

### 1) I initialize the size of the array with some room to grow

```javascript
var albumMaxSize = new array(10); 
albumMaxSize[0] = '23';
albumMaxSize[1] = '13';
albumMaxSize[2] = '14';
albumMaxSize[3] = '12';
albumMaxSize[4] = '21';
```

Now what if I want to add a new picture to the array? No problem.

```javascript
albumMaxSize[length] = '44';
```

### 2) Don't make it any bigger than you need right now

```javascript
var albumMinSize = ['23', '13', '14', '12', '21'];
```

But to add to it now, you must create a new array:
```javascript
var newAlbum = new array(album.length + 1);
for ( int i = 0; i < album.length; i++) {
  newAlbum[i] = album[i];
}
newAlbum[++i] = '34';
```

### Now what if I want to delete a photo from the album... say the picture at position 4
```javascript
var indexToDelete = 4;
var newAlbum[10];
for (int i = indexToDelete - 1 ; c < length - 1 ; i++ ) {
  array[i] = array[i+1];
}         
```

Similarly, to add a new picture, say at position 3, you need to copy all elements from position 3 onwards over one

## What if we wanted to avoid all of this copying over?
The reason elements in an array need to be side-by-side, is because we don't have any other property or field to tell us where the next element is. If we pair the data with an additional property called 'next'...

### Let's define our node

```javascript
function Node(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
}
```
### And our linked list

```javascript
function SinglyList() {
    this._length = 0;
    this.head = null;
}
```

## Now what do we need to do to remove a node / picture from position 4?
```javascript
SinglyList.prototype.remove = function(position) {
  var currentNode = this.head,
    length = this._length,
    count = 0,
    beforeNodeToDelete = null,
    nodeToDelete = null,
    
  // edge case handling... if position is invalid, etc
  ...
 
  // the first node is removed
  if (position === 1) {
    this.head = currentNode.next;
    currentNode = null;
    this._length--;
    return;
  }
 
  // any other node is removed
  while (count < position) {
    beforeNodeToDelete = currentNode;
    nodeToDelete = currentNode.next;
    count++;
  }
 
  beforeNodeToDelete.next = nodeToDelete.next;
  nodeToDelete = null;
  this._length--;
 
  return;
};
```

## Positives of linked lists:
+ Fast insertion / deletion
+ Linked lists let you insert elements at the beginning and end of the list in O(1) time. 
+ Linked lists also remove the overhead of bothering about the size of the data structure. The size need not to be known in advance.

## Drawbacks:
- Slow lookup: need to iterate through the list to find a specific node
- They do use more memory than arrays because of the pointers


For our next data structure, similar to linked lists, we will deal with nodes and pointers again to next nodes...

## Trees

The example we will use to discuss trees is the DOM. What is the DOM?

Itâ€™s an interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
It's a great example because you have lots of one-to-many relationships.

### Let's define our Node and Tree
```javascript
function Node(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.parent = null;
    this.children = [];
}
```

```javascript
function Tree(data) {
    var node = new Node(data);
    this._root = node;
}
```

### Some useful helper functions to help out...

```javascript
TreeNode.prototype.isLeaf = function () {
    return this.children.length == 0;
};
 
TreeNode.prototype.isRoot = function () {
    return this.parent == null;
};
```


## What does a tree traversal look like?

```javascript
Tree.prototype.traverse = function (callback) {
  callback(this.value);

  if (!this.children) {
    return;
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < this.children.length; i++) {
    var child = this.children[i];
    child.traverse(callback);
  }
};
```

Your callback can be anything here... a function to return all image type children, a counter function to find the number of images, a function that manipulates certain nodes, etc...


An interesting thing about the DOM, your browser knows how important it is for you to quickly access, read, change your DOM tree, so on top of being to traverse the tree like a tree, it also provides hash tables (dictionaries), to quickly look up specific elements (or nodes) of your tree by index. Hence, why you can use calls like:

```javascript
element = document.getElementById(id);
```
